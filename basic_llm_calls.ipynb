       "Gen AI, also known as Generative AI, is a type of artificial intelligence that uses complex algorithms and machine learning techniques to generate new, original content, such as text, images, videos, music, and more. Gen AI models are trained on large datasets, which enables them to learn patterns, relationships, and structures within the data.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some key characteristics of Gen AI include:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Generativity**: Gen AI models can generate new content that is not simply a copy of existing data. Instead, they create novel combinations of patterns, styles, and ideas.\n",
       "2. **Creativity**: Gen AI models can produce content that is not only new but also creative, meaning it can exhibit originality, innovation, and imagination.\n",
       "3. **Autonomy**: Gen AI models can work independently, without human intervention, to generate content.\n",
       "\n",
       "Types of Gen AI:\n",
